# Arcade Game Project

## Overview
This is an interactive browser-based implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Launch the index.html file in a browser window to start the game.

### How The Game Works
One player and many "enemies" are created when the game starts.  The player is moved using the arrow keys on the keyboard.  The player can move up, down, left and right but cannot move off the screen.  If the player reaches the top of the game board - the water - the player wins.  If the player collides with an enemy the game is reset and the player is returned to the starting position.
